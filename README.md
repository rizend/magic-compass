# what
Magic compass is a web app for people to find each other.
First one party generates a unique link and sends it to their friend.
Then both friends load magic_compass on their phones (or other mobile devices).
Both phones establish a connection to the magic compass server.
The phones send their location to the magic compass server both when they first
connect and whenever they move.  The server sends to each of the phones the
cardinal direction of the other phone.
